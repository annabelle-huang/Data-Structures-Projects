This is my first time using local testing, and I had to ask ULA to help me set 
up and understand how to use it. I have a bit of experience in C++ from before 
so I understood how to use classes, methods, and constructors easily. I needed
help with destructors and makeEmpty(), and learned what it means to deallocate
memory node by node. This problem set helped me clarify the private and public
elements. I also understood how to use temporary variables to traverse through
a list to insert, remove, and deallocate list memory. Overall, I think this
problem set is a smooth transition to C++.
