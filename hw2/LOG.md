|______|______________|____________|___________________________________________|
| 2/03 |    1:00pm    |    0:30    | read and understand assignment, write     |
|      |              |            | pseudocode                                |
| 2/07 |    12:00am   |    2:30    | understand assignment more, start coding  |
| 2/08 |    2:00pm    |    1:00    | completed setting the general structures  |
|      |              |            | of the functions                          |
| 2/09 |    3:00pm    |    3:00    | went to office hours to debug, learned    |
|      |              |            | more about the  different data types and  |
|      |              |            | how to convert and compare variable with  |
|      |              |            | different types                           |
| 2/10 |    11:00am   |    1:00    | fixed the incorrect code with deciding    |
|      |              |            | whether a cell should die or  not and got |
|      |              |            | correct simulation for each step          |
| 2/10 |    5:00pm    |    3:00    | included code to account for all          |
|      |              |            | assumptions and weird inputs, write       |
|      |              |            | comments for every function, went to      |
|      |              |            | office hours to degub the last two        |
|      |              |            | failing test cases                        |
| 2/11 |    9:00pm    |    3:00    | included condition to check whether       |
|      |              |            | command lines arguments have non-integer  |

# Discussion
I thought getting the correct next array was one of the harder parts for me. I originally thought it would be the easiest and assumed many if conditions that eventually didn't work out for test cases, but it ended up taking up the most time. I was also stuck on understanding the different types of pointers and arrays. I kept on receiving errors where I compare different types with each other, but I understood it more by searching up the types and going to office hours. Additionally, I learned how to pad strings with spaces until the string is a certain length.
