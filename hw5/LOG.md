# Discussion
I learned how to compare two text files using diff. Through this assignment, 
I learned what an AVL tree is and when and how to rotate it. I learned there
are four different cases when balancing an unbalanced tree and understood the
logic behind each case. This assignment greatly helped me in thinking about 
recursion and reminded me of CS201 p-sets. This is great practice for 
recursion. This assignment further helped me understand function methods and
the structure of a class. Overall, I learned a lot in a short amount of time,
but I think I should have started this p-set earlier.
