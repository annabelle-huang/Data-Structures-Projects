I thought setting up the environment was the hardest since I have never worked with VScode before and am not the best at command line prompts. I learned what a Makefile is, understood remote hosts, and how to generate keys. I encountered many errors when setting up the environment, such as repeatedly not being able to establish a connection to the zoo. But they were all resolved after I watched the zoom recording on setting up the IDE. I learned how to compile the program, and I did not have many bugs with the program itself.
