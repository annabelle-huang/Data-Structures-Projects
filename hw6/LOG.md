| 4/28 |    7:00pm    |    3:50    | I read over and understood assignment.    |
|      |              |            | Completed the smaller functions in
|      |              |            | Hashtable.cpp, including operator, find, 
|      |              |            | index_of, size, load_factor, etc. went to |
|      |              |            | office hours and debugged.                |
| 4/30 |    1:00pm    |    3:40    | Asked helped with insert function and     |

|      |              |            | ran book tests and got runtime under 10   |

# Discussion
I learned vector implementation and ore specifically vectors in vector and many 
functions associated with that. I became more familiar with grop and formed a 
solid understanding of the structure of vectors. I learned that I can treat
vectors like arrays and how to represent hashtables as vectors. I used recursive loop in writing the build_index function. Overall, this program helped me further
understand how hashing and chaining works and is very useful in learning vectors
in vector implementation. I learned hashing in class, though I think it would have been better and easier if I first learned more about vectors before this
assignment.
